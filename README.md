# Text-To-Speech-pyttsx3
This is a text to speech program using python (Using pyttsx3 library)
You give a text file path to system, then your system checks entered path validation and file type.
If condition passed then system read text file that given by path.
I tried to implement this project optimized by all platforms such as winows, mac os, linux but I'm not sure about it's correct execution on mac os / linux
because I didn't have access to these operating systems But it works well on windows(I checked it).
